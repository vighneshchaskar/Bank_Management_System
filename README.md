This system provides basic functionalities such as account creation, balance checks, fund transfers, and transaction history management. The project aims to demonstrate the use of JDBC for interacting with a relational database to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in a banking context.

## Features

- Balance Inquiry: Check the balance of any account.
- Fund Transfer: Transfer funds between accounts.
- Transaction History: View the transaction history for an account.
